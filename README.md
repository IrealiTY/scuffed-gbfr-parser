I won't be maintaining this, made something quick and dirty for me and my friends to compare damage on bosses with.


Features:
- Tracks **YOUR** damage accurately, including turrets in Protobaha and other similar quests and Rosetta's plants
- Automatic reset upon entering every **BOSS** quest

Known bugs/nuances:
- Protobaha Skyfall 1 adds ~20mil to damage for some reason lol
- Survival quests don't use the same timer function that boss quests do, so the parser doesn't reset automatically on them
